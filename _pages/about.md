*"The weight of evidence for an extraordinary claim must be proportioned to its strangeness."*
- *Pierre-Simon Laplace*

I am a PhD student at the Computer Vision Group at TU Munich under the guidance of [Prof. Cremers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cXQciMEAAAAJ&hl=en).
I mainly work on 3D & 4D reconstruction.

I am passionate about applying elegant mathematical theories to address practical, real-world challenges during my research.
